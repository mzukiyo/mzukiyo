# Kevin Kiyo 😎
## `Final Year Computer Science Student at University of Johannesburg`##

As a computer science student, I am a skilled programmer with a focus on Python and Java. I have a good foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software development. I am an agile learner, always eager to take on new challenges and come up with novel solutions. I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society. I am looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the field, whether through internships, co-op positions or other opportunities. I am a team player, having experience working on various group projects, and I am confident that my strong work ethic, determination and zeal for technology will help me excel in any software-oriented role. My goal is to become a software developer after graduation.
